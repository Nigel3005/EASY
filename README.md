## Before you start doing anything for the project.
Before you start programming you need to do a git pull request to get the latest version of the project.

    git pull origin main

If you want to make changes to the project, you need to create a new branch.

    git checkout -b <branch_name>

After you have made changes to the project, you need to add the files to the staging area.

    git add .

After you have added the files to the staging area, you need to commit the changes.

    git commit -m "commit message"

After you have committed the changes, you need to push the changes to the remote repository.

    git push

or, if you want to push the changes to a specific branch.

    git push origin <branch_name>
